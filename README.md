# DSA-DATA-ANALYSIS-CAPSTONE-PROJECT-AMAZON
I developed a dynamic Excel Dashboard analyzing 1,465 Amazon product reviews, uncovering insights on ratings, pricing, discounts, and revenue. Using pivot tables, calculated columns, slicers, and visualizations, the data analysis aims to help sellers make smarter, data-driven decisions.

## Case Study 1: Amazon Product Review Analysis

### Project Overview
This Data Analysis project focuses on analyzing Amazon product and customer review data to generate actionable insights for e-commerce sellers. The core objective of this project was to empower sellers with the knowledge and tools to:
 - Improve product quality based on real customer feedback
 - Refine marketing strategies using trends in reviews and ratings
 - Boost customer engagement and satisfaction through informed decisions

### Dataset Description 
The dataset contains information scraped from Amazon product pages, including:
- Products details: name, category, price, discount, and ratings.
- Customer engagement: user reviews, titles, and content.
- Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as Amazon Case Study.xlsx.
- Dataset Size: 1,465 Rows | 16 Columns

### Tool Used: Microsoft Excel 
 
### Process: Data Cleaning, Preparation and Visualizations
- In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation, I performed the following actions:
 - Remove duplicates from Product _Id 
 - Convert Text to Columns in Category column, select common delimited in the overall category details, set the delimiters contained in the data and click on Finish. Rename new category columns giving unique headers. 
 - Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort them when necessary using Filter tool.
 - Consistent and clean data with respect to data type, data format and values used 
 - Create Pivot Tables to summarize and segment data efficiently.
 - Calculated Columns to derive key performance indicators (e.g., Total potential revenue).
- Data Visualizations (Bar charts, tables, Pie chart, Scatter chart) to highlight trends in product ratings, discount behavior, pricing strategies, and review volume.
- Slicers and Filters for seamless interactivity and data exploration.
